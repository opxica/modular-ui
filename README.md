Calling on all the trendsetting Flutter enthusiasts! ❤️‍🔥 Join forces as we pioneer the creation of the ultimate, expansive, and seamless UI Library for Flutter. Let's make waves together! 🚀

## Setting Up Locally :
1.  Run `flutter create .` inside the project folder to generate any necessary files
2.  Go inside project root and run `flutter packages pub global activate --source path .` and export the PATH if necessary or add the path as an Environment Variable.
3.  Now you can import the local version of modular_ui and test it during your development
```
dependencies:
  modular_ui:
    path: <replace_with_cloned_repo_location>
```
4.  `import 'package:modular_ui/modular_ui.dart';` in your other flutter project.


## Design Language :
ModularUI Design language is inspired by [Material Tailwind](https://www.material-tailwind.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) 
Our current goal is to make as much components as possible and shit this asap, so we might merge any widget that looks like them or if they are consistent with our theme, obviously the future goal would be to make them perfect and consistent.

## Widget Naming Convention :
any widget of ModularUI must follow this naming convention : `MUI<widget_name>` e.g. `MUIPrimaryButton`
MUI stands for ModularUI.

### Series of events : How we began

While casually scrolling through Twitter, [I](https://twitter.com/twtutkarsh) stumbled upon an intriguing [tweet](https://x.com/luke_pighetti/status/1740122310714007820?s=20) from [Luke](https://twitter.com/luke_pighetti) that sparked a burst of inspiration within me. Fueling my curiosity, I conducted a [Poll](https://x.com/twtutkarsh/status/1740331978392809748?s=20) on Luke's original post, and to my delight, several individuals expressed interest. Emboldened by this positive response, I decided to take the plunge.

Enter [Yash](https://twitter.com/Yash_khattar73), a kindred spirit who shared my enthusiasm. Together, we embraced the challenge with rocket-like enthusiasm 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

Sharing our endeavor on Twitter garnered an impressive reception, surpassing even my own expectations. [Tweet link](https://x.com/twtutkarsh/status/1741548976892186718?s=20)

And now, the moment has arrived—our modular_ui repository is officially public! We're optimistic that it will find a welcoming home among Flutter developers, paving the way for a custom UI library tailored for the Flutter community.
